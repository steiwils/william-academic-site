I am an enthusiastic data science practitioner coming from a biology background. My interests focus on computer vision deep learning methods, mainly focused around their application in biomedical imaging for cardiovascular disease. I also have a side passion of advocating for better built environments and using my data science skills to help advocate for more human centric design.
