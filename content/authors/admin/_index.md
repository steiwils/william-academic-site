My name is William Steinke and I am a data science and machine learning practitioner, with a background in microbiology. I find great joy in exploring ways to use data to improve people’s lives. My lived experiences and scientific curiosity lead me to explore deep learning for biomedical image analysis and data analysis to advocate for better urbanism. I have a Master’s degree from [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/) and the [Medical College of Wisconsin](https://www.mcw.edu/) in Bioinformatics and a Bachelor's degree from [UW-Stevens Point](https://www.uwsp.edu/) in Biochemistry. While in my Master’s program, I worked at the Medical College of Wisconsin where we used NLP and computer vision techniques for brain tumor MRI images. I am a member of [Strong Towns](https://strongtowns.org/about) and involved in a [Local Conversation](https://www.strongtownsmetromke.org/).
