subtitle: 'An overview of the implementation of the models on open source medical imaging datasets.'
summary: "During my graduate studies, I read a paper on arxiv.org that peaked my curiosity, and spurred my pursuit of AI in the biomedical field. Here, I implement some of the models mentioned in that paper to ope source medical imaging datasets, and explore the underlying nature of the models as well as additional data science project techniques."

I have always been someone prone to follow wherever curiosity might lead. Often, this path is less charted, but thoroughly fulfilling. This is a story about such an event. 

During my graduate studies at Marquette University, I came across a [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14773.pdf) that cause me to take pause. A brief peruse of the paper lead me to a more substantive immersion into the paper. Armed with various colors of highlighters and pen in hand for jotting notes or thoughts in the margin, I devoured the content. 

This was my first serious foray into reading literature on deep learning models. I had attempted in the past, with various degrees of success, but the subject matter of this one made all of it click. Like most things in science, I left the experience of reading this paper full of more questions than when I had arrived. But I also left with the delightfully mind tingling sensation of being curios. My mind became pleasantly fixated on ponderings derived from this work. Perhaps some of this was due to the vantage point between naivete and knowledge I possessed at the time. I was not new to the concepts of Deep Learning, or to the realm of biology. But combining the two in such a manner and context, this was certainly new. However, because of the vague familiarity I felt I had with content of this paper, and the full tank of curiosity, I felt emboldened not dismayed, which others may feel when confronting new knowledge or situations. And so, I set off on this new path, to see where this curiosity might take me. It has lead me to here, so far...

# Background: The Paper

Now, that is out of the way. I can explain a bit about what was all in the paper so you don't have to go and read the whole thing.
