I’ve tried in the past, but was never able to quite get the aesthetic right. This will not be the final form of this website either, but I’m already at a much better place with its construction than I was in the past.\nI hope to have this website be a bit of a digital resume, profile and portfolio, along with general blog about my thoughts and works in a professional or quasi-professional manner. You’ll probably see some things about courses I’m taking to continue developing in data science and artificial intelligence, but don’t be surprised to see something related to urbanism of Strong Towns related analysis.\nThe Posts section of this website is meant to be a little more relaxed, yet informative. Whatever deep learning projects I find interesting enough, I’ll include a post related to it here. But like I said, you might find posts related to other topics here too!\nBuilding the Website A quick note on the construction of this website. I’ll probalby include a more thourough explination on how I did this in a dedicated post, but for now let me give you the brief rundown.\nI am using blogdown in R and the Hugo theme Academic from Wowcemy. I’ve built this website starting in 2023, and at the time there were some tutorials I found that referenced a content/home/ folder. When I followed the instructions seen here and in this video, I did not get this content/home/ folder. Instead, I got a lot of _index.md files in the content/ folder. From what I can gather, these markdown files are the stand ins for the content/home/ organization that was seen previously. If you open one of these files, and run the blogdown::serve_site() command, you should be able to start playing around with to contents of the markdown files, and see what they do to the starter site. This is a little less intuitive than my previous blogdown experience where you interacted with .Rmd files and then knitted them to reflect the changes or additions to your site, but with a little time and patience I (and hopefully you) was able to figure it out.\nAny how, thanks for stopping by. I hope you find something interesting!\nPeace,\nWilliam\n","date":1694044800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694044800,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"https://example.com/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2023-09-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome 👋 this is my first post on my new site.
